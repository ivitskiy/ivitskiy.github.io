I am a mathematician applying optimization theory to systems that operate under uncertainty.

My academic work focused on mathematical modeling of non-Newtonian fluids and polymer composites - complex physical systems where classical equations fail. This research produced 200+ publications, 50+ patents, and earned the President of Ukraine's Prize for Young Scientists (2018).

Today I apply the same analytical approach to two domains:

**Computational Advertising.** Modern ad platforms are black-box optimization systems. I reverse-engineer their bid algorithms, measure causal incrementality, and build systematic frameworks for budget allocation at scale.

**Human-AI Interaction.** Large language models create new paradigms for human-computer collaboration. I research and build systems that optimize this interaction — from prompt engineering methodologies to AI-augmented decision workflows.

### Research Interests

* Causal inference in noisy auction environments
* Reverse-engineering of ad platform algorithms
* Systematic frameworks for human-LLM collaboration
* Control theory applications in marketing operations
